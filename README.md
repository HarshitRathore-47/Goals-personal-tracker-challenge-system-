How others install dependencies
When someone clones your repo:

They get the package.json and package-lock.json files.
They run:
 copy
bash

npm install
This automatically downloads and installs all the required dependencies to node_modules.
How to ensure node_modules is excluded
Add node_modules to your .gitignore file (usually already present in most Node.js projects):

 copy
javascript

node_modules/
This prevents accidentally committing node_modules to your Git repository.

Summary for README install instructions
In your README, instruct users to:

 copy
bash

npm install
to install all dependencies based on the manifest files.

If you want, I can help generate .gitignore and README instructions to reflect this best practice!
